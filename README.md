## INFORMATION FOR COLLABORATERS
<details>
<summary>GIT FLOWCHART</summary>
This flowchart/tutorial makes the assumption you already have GIT setup, that you have acces to the GGJ-2023 repository, and that you have GITHub desktop installed.
If you havn't, please contact Simpia about that first. 

If you want to make an asset, and make sure its available, or you want to acces others files on GIT, this is for you.

1) Branches
During work, we'll be switching between the 'main' branch, and our private branches. If you havn't already, in Github go to branches>new branch and make one.
please
Make a habit of having your personal branch selected while working. (more on that below)
Make a habbit of fetching origin and merging your branch with the main branch before starting working on something.(more on that below)
Make a habbit of pushing done work onto GIT (more on that below)
When ready to share your work, make a pull request (more on that below)

2) Files between your PC, branches, and GIT
When you put a file in the GGJ-2023 repository on your computer, it will be just there. However, GITHUB will recognise it, and add it to the list of changes in your currently selected branch.
Hopefully you had your personal branch selected. If you didn't, Github will ask you wether you want to bring your changes along with you, or wether you want to leave them in the branch you had open. 
Generally, you want to bring them along to your personal branch at this point. 
Either way, these files are still only on your PC at this time. To bring them to GIT, you need to push them.

3) Fetching Files, and making sure you are up to date with MAIN
Before you start working on something, it's a good habbit to regularly make sure you are up to date with other peoples contributions.
First of all, click the 'Fetch Origin' button, and let that process. If it finds something, click again to process these changes. 
Then
Make sure your personal branch is up to date with 'main' branch by going to Current branch*>choose a branch to merge into ___> Main>create a merge commit
* make sure the branch you want to bring up to date is the current branch. usually this is your personal branch

You can also use this to merge files between 2 personal branches, but you'll generally use it with main. Don't merge into personal branches without discussing it with that person first. 

4) Pushing files/changes
To push changes onto GIT, make sure the changes listed by GIT you want to push are checked.
They are also color coded: Green - New files, Orange - Modified, Red - Removed. If you see any red changes, please check carefully if you actually intend to delete that file. 
When you have the changes checked you want to make, write a summary of these changes (mandatory) and a more elaborate description if needed (optional). Then commit them to your branch. 
Originally you want to push them to your personal branch. They should now be on GIT, as well as on your computer. 

5) Pull request
If you have done one or several pushes, you might want to get them into 'MAIN', for this you need a pull request.
Go to Branch(top bar)>Pull request. It should open in your browser. 
Make sure it says "Main" < "Yourbranchname", assuming thats what you want to have pulled (it'll be the most common transaction)
Write some info about the things you need pulled in relevant, and click on the green button.
You'll go to a next screen, and it might say that there are no issues and you're safe to pull, but don't press the green button here. That's Simpia's(DZNeggs4Keira) call to make.
Under current branch>Pull requests, you now should see your request. When the request is Pulled, it should now be available in main. 

Hope this helps!
